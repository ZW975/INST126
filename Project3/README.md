I, Zijing Wang will finish this project on my own.

1. 
After reading file, use readlines to create a list of strings.
Iterate and split(" ") every string
Iterate the list and make it into a list of dictionary using e-mails as keys
For each dictionary, check times of login and login times
Once found a case, total_count += 1
Generate output

2.
After reading file, use readlines to create a list of strings.
Iterate and split(" ") every string
Iterate the list and creat a list of dictionarys dicitonaries using login date as keys(split date and time first of course)
check total login times and log out times
Once found a case, total_count += 1
Generate output

4.
After reading file, use readlines to create a list of strings.
Iterate and split(" ") every string
Take all the e-mail address out and form a new list
Split("@") for every string in the list
Take the domain out
Make a dictionary using domains as keys, and count appearing times
Generate output

Note for myself:
For all the data I have, maybe I need to add more datatypes to store different part of input.
Also, I need to consider how to sort list etc. to not mess up everything.
