I, Zijing Wang will finish this project on my own.

1. 
After reading file, use readlines to create a list of strings.
Iterate and split() every string
Iterate the list and make it into a list of dictionary using date as keys, and sort them
After keys, which are dates, there are dictionary use e-mail address as keys and followed by user behaviors
For each dictionary, check times of login and login times
Once found a case, total_count += 1
Generate output

4.
Read the whole file
Take all the e-mail address out and form a new list
Split("@") for every string in the list
Take the domain out
Make a dictionary using domains as keys, and count appearing times
Generate output
